# textsummarization
Automatic text summarization is the technique, where a computer is endorsed with the work of summarizing a text. A text is entered into the computer and a summarized text is returned, which is a non redundant extract from the original text. According to Radev et al, a summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts, that conveys important information in the original text, and that is no longer than half of the original text and usually significantly less than that. In other words, the main goal of a summary is to present the main ideas in a document in less space.

There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: extraction and abstraction. <hr>
ABSTRACTION: 
The abstraction technique entails paraphrasing and shortening parts of the source document. When abstraction is applied for text summarization in deep learning problems, it can overcome the grammar inconsistencies of the extractive method. 
The abstractive text summarization algorithms create new phrases and sentences that relay the most useful information from the original text — just like humans do.
 For example: The same sentence above is converted in abstraction Abstractive summary: Joseph and Mary came to Jerusalem where Jesus was born.<hr>
EXTRACTION
 The extractive text summarization technique involves pulling keyphrases from the source document and combining them to make a summary. The extraction is made according to the defined metric without making any changes to the texts. For example: Source text: Joseph and Mary rode on a donkey to attend the annual event in Jerusalem. In the city, Mary gave birth to a child named Jesus. Extractive summary: Joseph and Mary attend event Jerusalem. Mary birth Jesus.
