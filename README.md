# textsummarization
Automatic text summarization is the technique, where a computer is endorsed with the work of summarizing a text. A text is entered into the computer and a summarized text is returned, which is a non redundant extract from the original text. According to Radev et al, a summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts, that conveys important information in the original text, and that is no longer than half of the original text and usually significantly less than that. In other words, the main goal of a summary is to present the main ideas in a document in less space.
